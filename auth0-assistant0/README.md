## Assistant0: An AI Personal Assistant for Gmail Secured with Auth0

Imagine an AI personal assistant that helps you manage your emails by dynamically accessing Gmail to read and compose messages. Here's how it works:

1. **Gmail Integration:** The assistant can search your inbox, read emails, and compose drafts. It can help you stay organized by summarizing conversations, highlighting important messages, and drafting replies.

With tool-calling capabilities, the AI agent can securely access your Gmail using Auth0 Token Vault, without storing your credentials in the application.

### Security Challenges with Tool Calling AI Agents

Building such an assistant is not that difficult. Thanks to frameworks like [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), and [Vercel AI](https://vercel.com/ai), you can get started quickly. The difficult part is doing it securely so that you can protect the user's data and credentials.

Many current solutions involve storing credentials and secrets in the AI agent application’s environment or letting the agent impersonate the user. This is not a good idea, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities and excessive scope and access for the AI agent.

When you build an AI agent, you need to consider all the other security implications of it as well. You don't want an LLM to have unlimited access to your personal data like email and documents, and more importantly, you don't want to provide your credentials to the LLM to access these tools. Let's face it, regardless of how secure the LLM is, there is always a possibility of it getting manipulated into divulging sensitive information or doing something you don't want it to do.

### Tool Calling with the Help of Auth0

This is where Auth0 comes to the rescue. As the leading identity provider (IdP) for modern applications, our upcoming product, [Auth for GenAI](https://auth0.com/blog/auth-for-genai/), provides standardized ways built on top of OAuth and OpenID Connect to call APIs of tools on behalf of the end user from your AI agent.

Auth0 becomes the proxy between your AI agent and the tools you want to call. This way, the agent and LLM do not have access to the credentials and can only call the tools with the permissions you have defined in Auth0. This also means your AI agent only needs to talk to Auth0 for authentication and not the tools directly, making integrations easier.

#### Call first-party APIs on users' behalf

When your AI agent, secured with Auth0, wants to call another API secured with Auth0 on the same tenant, you can use the standard OAuth 2 flows, like Authorization Code Flow, to get an API token from that application with user consent. In this case, Auth0 provides the API access token to the AI agent.

#### Call third-party APIs on users' behalf

When your AI agent, secured with Auth0, wants to call external services like Gmail, Calendar, Slack, and Google Drive, Auth0 can help the agent get access tokens for the external service on behalf of the end user. In this case, Auth0 brokers the API access token from the external service to the AI agent.

This is made possible by Federated API token exchange, which is a way to obtain an access token from an external identity provider without the need for the user to re-authenticate every time. The end user authenticates and connects the external service once, and Auth0 intermediates the authentication and authorization process and provides the API access token to the AI agent. Auth0 takes care of storing refresh tokens and getting new access tokens when the current access token expires.

## About the template

This template scaffolds an Auth0 + Vercel AI SDK + Next.js starter app. It mainly uses the following libraries:

- Vercel's [AI SDK](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai) to stream tokens to the client and display the incoming messages.
- The Auth0 [AI SDK](https://github.com/auth0-lab/auth0-ai-js) and [Next.js SDK](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0) to secure the application and call third-party APIs.

It's Vercel's free-tier friendly too! Check out the [bundle size stats below](#-bundle-size).

You can check out a hosted version of this repo here: //TODO

> This template is derived from the [🦜️🔗 LangChain + Next.js Starter Template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nextjs-template). It has been simplified and upgraded to fit the use case of an AI personal assistant secured with Auth0.

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, clone this repo and download it locally.

Next, you'll need to set up environment variables in your repo's `.env.local` file. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`.
To start with the basic examples, you'll just need to add your OpenAI API key and Auth0 credentials.

Because this app is made to run in serverless Edge functions, make sure you've set the `LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND` environment variable to `false` to ensure tracing finishes if you are using [LangSmith tracing](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).

Next, install the required packages using your preferred package manager (e.g. `bun install` or `npm install`).

Now you're ready to run the development server:

```bash
bun dev # or npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result! Ask the bot something and you'll see a streamed response:

![A streaming conversation between the user and the AI](/public/images/chat-conversation.png)

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Backend logic lives in `app/api/chat/route.ts`. From here, you can change the prompt and model, or add other modules and logic.

## 📦 Bundle size

![bundle-size](/public/images/bundle-size.png)

This package has [@next/bundle-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/bundle-analyzer) set up by default - you can explore the bundle size interactively by running:

```bash
$ ANALYZE=true npm run build
```
